        <h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>
          I spent the most time interacting with the elements in the footer.
          This website primarily offers simple interactions like scrolling down
          and using the navigation bar, without more complex interactions. As a
          result, I mainly focused on clicking the trash bin at the bottom or
          exploring the surrounding elements like the dragon or the cat.

        <h3>4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p>
          Since there weren’t many interactions required from the user on this
          website, scrolling down was the most frequent action I performed.

          <h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
          <p>
            The main purpose of this website is to educate users about the
            importance of essential jobs, particularly janitorial work. The site
            aims to help users deeply understand the value of these professions
            and encourage them to express gratitude for the hard work of those who
            perform them. Through an interactive experience, the website seeks to
            break down social prejudices, promote responsible behavior, and foster
            appreciation and respect for people in these roles.

          <h3>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
          <p>
            The website is structured with a top navigation bar and a simple
            scrolling feature, which allows users to focus on the content without
            unnecessary distractions. The straightforward design helps users
            immerse themselves in the core message of the site, with the story
            gradually unfolding through stop-motion animation as they scroll. This
            sequential storytelling method enables users to naturally grasp the
            importance of essential jobs as they follow the content's flow. The
            scene where a cigarette butt is thrown on the ground particularly
            resonated with me, deepening my connection with the website's message.

          <h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h3>
          <p>
            This website seems designed for a single visit, delivering a powerful
            message in a short amount of time, without requiring repeated visits.
            One visit should be enough for users to fully understand the site's
            purpose and develop a sense of awareness about the importance of these
            professions. The use of stop-motion animation focuses on providing a
            short, intense experience rather than promoting long-term interaction,
            aiming to create a strong impact in a brief interaction.

          <h3>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
          <p>
            This website emphasizes a single visit. The stop-motion animation and
            collage-like visuals immediately immerse the user, and the site is
            designed to leave a lasting impression with just one experience. By
            scrolling down, the content naturally unfolds, ensuring that users
            fully experience the site during their initial visit. The narrative is
            clearly divided so that users can consume all the content and
            understand the message completely on their first visit. As a result,
            the content is designed to be thoroughly experienced without needing
            additional visits.

        <h3>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p>
          This website delivers its message in a way similar to social awareness
          campaigns but with a deeper, more reflective approach. Like
          <em>Hollow - An Interactive Documentary</em>, <em>The Boat - SBS</em>,
          and <em>Every Last Drop</em>, it uses strong visual imagery and
          gradually unfolding stories to encourage users to take their time and
          think deeply about the content. The site also reminds me of the
          montage technique in film, where each scene comes together to create
          an overall narrative, inviting users to explore the meaning of each
          part on their own. Additionally, the visual and storytelling style is
          reminiscent of turning the pages of a collage art book, much like the
          approach seen in <em>Every Last Drop</em>. Each page combines
          different images and text in a way that encourages the user not just
          to read the information but to contemplate it deeply, offering a more
          immersive experience.

        <h3>10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>
          This website, much like <em>Hollow</em>, <em>The Boat</em>, and
          <em>Every Last Drop</em>, encourages users to take their time
          exploring the content and carefully examining each scene. Through the
          use of stop-motion animation and collage images, it prompts users not
          to rush through the information but to think deeply about the message
          being conveyed in each part. The site is designed to make users pause
          and reflect on the meaning behind each scene, rather than simply
          scrolling through, similar to these other experiences.

        <h3>11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>
          This website is designed to make users think seriously about the topic
          and feel a sense of responsibility as they navigate the content. Like
          <em>Hollow</em> and <em>The Boat</em>, it uses visual storytelling to
          evoke more than just an informational response, encouraging users to
          deeply appreciate the importance and impact of the subject. Through
          this experience, users naturally develop a sense of respect for the
          profession and its significance.

        <h3>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        <p>
          The most frustrating part was when I scrolled down, and the photos
          transitioned into an animation. The animation felt choppy and didn’t
          flow smoothly, which disrupted the storytelling and made it hard to
          stay engaged. Additionally, the interaction was limited to just
          scrolling down through the introduction and main content, which became
          repetitive and made the overall experience feel monotonous. Except for
          the final part, there weren’t many interactive elements, which left me
          somewhat disappointed as I expected more varied interactions.

        <h3>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <p>
          The most satisfying part for me was how the animation was seamlessly
          created using photos. For example, in the landing page, the photos
          moved from side to side, making it look like a person was actually
          walking, and the scene where a janitor sweeps trash into a dustpan at
          the top was particularly impressive. These details made the content
          more immersive and helped me engage more deeply with the website.
