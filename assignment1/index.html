            I spent the most time interacting with the elements in the footer.
            This website primarily offers simple interactions like scrolling
            down and using the navigation bar, without more complex
            interactions. As a result, I mainly focused on clicking the trash

          <p>
            The main purpose of this website is to educate users about the
            importance of essential jobs, particularly janitorial work. The site
            aims to help users deeply understand the value of these professions
            and encourage them to express gratitude for the hard work of those
            who perform them. Through an interactive experience, the website
            seeks to break down social prejudices, promote responsible behavior,
            and foster appreciation and respect for people in these roles.

          </h3>
          <p>
            The website is structured with a top navigation bar and a simple
            scrolling feature, which allows users to focus on the content
            without unnecessary distractions. The straightforward design helps
            users immerse themselves in the core message of the site, with the
            story gradually unfolding through stop-motion animation as they
            scroll. This sequential storytelling method enables users to
            naturally grasp the importance of essential jobs as they follow the
            content's flow. The scene where a cigarette butt is thrown on the
            ground particularly resonated with me, deepening my connection with
            the website's message.

            This website seems designed for a single visit, delivering a

            the importance of these professions. The use of stop-motion
            animation focuses on providing a short, intense experience rather
            than promoting long-term interaction, aiming to create a strong
            impact in a brief interaction.

            narrative is clearly divided so that users can consume all the
            content and understand the message completely on their first visit.
            As a result, the content is designed to be thoroughly experienced
            without needing additional visits.

          <p>
            The most frustrating part was when I scrolled down, and the photos
            transitioned into an animation. The animation felt choppy and didn’t
            flow smoothly, which disrupted the storytelling and made it hard to
            stay engaged. Additionally, the interaction was limited to just
            scrolling down through the introduction and main content, which
            became repetitive and made the overall experience feel monotonous.
            Except for the final part, there were not many interactive elements,
            which left me somewhat disappointed as I expected more varied
            interactions.

            The most satisfying part for me was how the animation was seamlessly
            created using photos. For example, in the landing page, the photos
            moved from side to side, making it look like a person was actually
            walking, and the scene where a janitor sweeps trash into a dustpan
            at the top was particularly impressive. These details made the
